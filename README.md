# NNR
A simple no recoil script with pattern generator, that supports multiple weapons.

### Prerequisites

Python 3.7 Libraries:
> win32api

> cv2

> numpy

### Using

```
-> Print your weapon spray and save it.
```
```
-> Open it and apply 200% zoom.
```
```
-> Run "readpattern.py" and start clicking the bullet marks (from the first to the last). You should hear a "beep" sound for each one you click.
```
```
-> The pattern for that weapon is saved in "pattern.txt", copy it and paste it under "pattern" in your weapon's json object (just create one like the examples I gave and insert your pattern there).
```
```
-> Print your weapon icon and save it in "wdata" folder just like the examples.
```
```
-> Run norecoil.py, and press F8 to toggle, F10 to close the script.
```
```
